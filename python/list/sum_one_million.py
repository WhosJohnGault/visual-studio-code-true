# Make a list of the numbers from one to one million,
# and then use min() and max() to make sure your list actually starts at one and
# ends at one million Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly Python can
# add a million numbers
numbers=[i for i in range(1,1000001)]
print("the first entry is",min(numbers),"the last entry is",max(numbers),"the sum is",sum(numbers))
